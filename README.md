# toll-free-harness

Full-featured user interaction simulator for terminal-based coding agents.

`toll-free-harness` models the complete user interaction surface of a coding agent CLI — prompting, answering questions, reviewing plans — as typed APIs. It spawns the agent in a local PTY, observes events through read-only hooks, and responds through the same keystroke channel a real user would.

Currently supports **Claude Code**. The framework is designed to add support for other coding agents whose headless modes do not fully expose the interactive user experience.

The name is a joke about toll booths around developer workflows.

## What this project is not

Not an API proxy, credential-sharing service, or billing workaround. Users run their own local tools with their own accounts and must comply with those tools' terms.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add toll-free-harness node-pty
```

## Quick start

```typescript
import { ClaudeCodeSession } from "toll-free-harness";

const session = new ClaudeCodeSession({
  args: ["--model", "opus"],
  cwd: "/path/to/project",
  prompt: "Fix the failing tests",
});

// Handle the agent's questions — return which option to select
session.onAskUserQuestion(async (event) => {
  console.log(event.text);
  console.log(event.questions[0]?.options.map((o, i) => `${i}: ${o.label}`));
  return { selectedIndex: 0 };
});

// Handle plan review — approve or reject with feedback
session.onExitPlanMode(async (event) => {
  console.log(event.planText.slice(0, 200));
  return { decision: "approve" };
});

const result = await session.run();

// Send a follow-up prompt (with optional images)
session.sendPrompt("Now add tests for the fix", {
  images: ["/tmp/screenshot.png"],
});
```

## User interactions

The framework models three user interactions as dedicated typed APIs:

| Interaction | API | You provide | Library does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prompting** | `sendPrompt(text, options?)` | Text + optional image paths | Injects keystrokes into PTY |
| **Answering questions** | `onAskUserQuestion(handler)` | `{ selectedIndex }` | Navigates and selects the option |
| **Reviewing plans** | `onExitPlanMode(handler)` | `{ decision: "approve" }` or `{ decision: "reject", feedback }` | Approves or rejects via keystrokes |

There is no raw `write()` — the library translates your typed decisions into the correct keystrokes internally.

## Hook listeners (read-only)

Observe agent events without sending data back:

```typescript
session.onPreToolUse("Bash", (event) => {
  console.log(`Running: ${event.toolInput?.command}`);
});

session.onPostToolUse("*", (event) => {
  console.log(`Tool ${event.toolName} completed`);
});

session.onStop(() => {
  console.log("Session ended");
});
```

Available: `onPreToolUse`, `onPostToolUse`, `onPermissionRequest`, `onStop`, `onUserPromptSubmit`. All are read-only — hooks return `{}` internally and never send data back to the agent.

## Event guardrail

Wait for specific events with timeouts for deterministic test flows:

```typescript
const event = await session.guardrail.expect(
  { kind: "pre_tool_use", toolName: "Bash" },
  10_000,
);
```

## Timing model

`PreToolUse` and `Stop` hooks are **blocking** — the agent waits for them. Keystrokes injected during a blocking hook callback buffer in PTY stdin and are consumed by the UI after the hook returns. `PermissionRequest` is **non-blocking** — the dialog renders in parallel.

## How it works

1. `run()` starts an HTTP server on a Unix domain socket (`/tmp/toll-free-<uuid>.sock`)
2. Writes hook configuration to `$HOME/.claude/settings.json`
3. Spawns the agent in a PTY with your args and prompt
4. Agent hooks call a bundled Node.js client that posts events to the socket
5. Your interaction handlers and listeners receive events; responses go through PTY keystrokes
6. On exit, the socket is cleaned up

**Note:** `run()` overwrites `$HOME/.claude/settings.json`. Use `env.HOME` to isolate:

```typescript
new ClaudeCodeSession({ ..., env: { HOME: "/tmp/isolated" } });
```

## Cross-platform

Uses Node.js `http.request({ socketPath })` for IPC — works on macOS, Linux, and Windows 10 1803+.
